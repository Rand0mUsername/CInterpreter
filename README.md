CInterpreter
=============
A fork of a C interpreter from [SKantar/CInterpreter](https://github.com/skantar/CInterpreter/) with several features added as a part of Compiler Construction coursework. Implemented a number of C STL functions and added support for more datatypes, pointers, arrays, memory addressing, dynamic allocation and control flow statements.
